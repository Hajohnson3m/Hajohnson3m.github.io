            <p>I am interested in Human Computer Interaction and Interactive design from a movement/embodied perspective.
                 WIth my background in dance, I have learned that movement has a lot to offer interns of connection with the self, 
                 environment and others. I would like to explore the intersection of this phenomenon with interactive technology, 
                 focusing on the issue of technology resulting in a feeling of disconnect from the self, the environment, and our 
                 community. I strongly believe that humanity's strength lies in the ability to connect and form communities. 
                 I hope by returning to this, it can empower us to make significant environmental and social changes. 
                 I want people to feel like technology is a conductor for their humanity instead of an imprisoning box 
                 that is used to control them like robots. And this might mean radically changing what technology looks like. 
                 I am also deeply interested in how marginalized communities adopt/hack technology as part of their culture and 
                 how technology can be designed to support the needs and enjoyments of these communities. I believe it is important 
                 to examine the ethics and morality of emerging technologies and if/how they can be redirected to help us reconnect 
                 with our natural environment and our physical community. I am interested in all these topics from a feminist, queer, 
                 inclusive and anti-racial perspectiveI am interested in Human Computer Interaction and Interactive design from a movement/embodied perspective.
