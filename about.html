                <p>My passions lie at the intersection of embodiment, interactive technology, environment, and disability justice. The interplay between my artistic and technical background inspires me to explore the role interactive technology plays in creating connection. I received my BS in Theoretical Mathematics and my BS in Computer Science Engineering from the Ohio State University. As someone who had danced their whole life, I am constantly seeking ways to participate in community and learn about different cultures through artistic movement.</p>

            <h1>Longer Bio</h1>
            <p>My passions lie at the intersection of embodiment, interactive technology, environment, and disability justice. The interplay between my artistic 
                and technical background led me to speculate on the role interactive technology plays in creating connection, specifically how embodied knowledge
                 could reshape perceptions of disability and its connection to the environment. By exploring disability as an ecological issue, I aim to reconcile
                  the benefits of accommodating disability through technology with its detrimental impact on ecosystems. While most of my past research implemented
                   algorithmic techniques, I value the nuance contributed to pluralistic dialogues by methodologies like ethnography and design fiction. Fueled by
                a passion for social justice, I seek to redefine interactive design research for impactful change by integrating dance.

            <br>
            <p>My experiences as a disabled dancer uniquely position me in the field of Human Computer Interaction. I trained in ballet for 13 years, performing 
                often in the Nutcracker, Cinderella, and Coppelia. I dabbled in other dance styles like tap, modern, and character. At 16, I quit because my body 
                could not uphold the rigorous strain and standards enforced by ballet. However, during my undergrad I began trying to heal my relationship with it.
                 And so began the journey of decolonizing my understanding of dance. I discovered movement holds a greater purpose than entertainment. It serves as
                  a medium to explore emotionally wrought topics and transcend intersectional identity barriers, showcasing the humanity of historically 
                  misunderstood individuals. During this journey, I have widened my movement vocabulary by studying swing dance and going to Lindy Hop socials 
                  whenever I travel. I have moved my focus away from how my body looks, towards emoting and creating connection with those I dance with.

            <p>During my undergrad at Ohio State University, I studied Theoretical Math and Computer Science Engineering. In summer 2020 I conducted graph 
                research, trying to generalize Stanley's Acyclic Orientations Theorem to signed graphs. The following summer, I interned at JP Morgan Chase, 
                completing data analysis projects for their home lending department. I spent the summer of 2022 in Toronto, working on creating a biomedical 
                hyperspectral image analysis package as part of the Fields Institute REU. I have a passion for creating equitable opportunities, so I served as 
                the undergraduate representative of the Diversity and Departmental Climate Committee for the Math department. I also was the social media chair 
                for OSU’s Association of Women in Mathematics.  In between undergrad and my master’s, I volunteered in a remote village in the mountains of 
                Washington as a Graphic Designer. Currently, I am completing a master’s in Interactive Media Technology at KTH in Stockholm.
