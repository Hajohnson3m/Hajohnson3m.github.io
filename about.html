                <h1>Breif Bio</h1>
                <p>My passions lie at the intersection of embodiment, environment, interactive technology, and disability justice. The dissonance between my artistic and technical backgrounds inspires me to critically explore the complex connections between humans and their more-than-human counterparts. I aim to weave my technical background into a tapestry of art and activism. As a dancer, I strive to redefine dance as an accessible community-building practice, constantly seeking ways to participate in community and learn about different cultures through artistic movement. I received my BS in Theoretical Mathematics and Computer Science Engineering from Ohio State University. Currently, I am completing my master's in Interactive Media Technology at KTH Royal Institute of Technology.

            <h1>Longer Bio</h1>
            <p>The interplay between my artistic and technical background leads me to speculate on the role interactive technology plays in creating connection, specifically how embodied knowledge could reshape perceptions of disability and its connection to the environment. By exploring disability as an ecological issue, I aim to reconcile the benefits of accommodating disability through technology with its detrimental impact on ecosystems. I value the nuance contributed to pluralistic dialogues by social science methodologies like ethnography and design fiction. Fueled by a passion for social justice, I seek to redefine interactive design research for impactful change by integrating dance.</p>
            <br>
            <p>My experiences as a disabled dancer uniquely position me as an artist, designer, and researcher. I trained in ballet for 13 years, performing often in the Nutcracker, Cinderella, and Coppelia. I dabbled in other dance styles like tap, modern, and character. At 16, I quit because my body could not uphold the rigorous strain and standards enforced by ballet. However, during my undergrad, I began trying to heal my relationship with it. And so began the journey of decolonizing my understanding of dance. I discovered movement holds a greater purpose than entertainment. It serves as a medium to explore emotionally wrought topics and transcend intersectional identity barriers, showcasing the humanity of historically misunderstood individuals. During this journey, I have widened my movement vocabulary by learning new forms such as swing dance and contact improv.  Whenever I travel, I find community in dance whether I'm dancing in a park or at a social dance event. I have moved my focus away from how my body looks, towards emoting and creating a connection with those I dance with.

            <p>During my undergrad at Ohio State University, I studied Theoretical Math and Computer Science Engineering. In the summer of 2020, I conducted graph research, trying to generalize Stanley's Acyclic Orientations Theorem to signed graphs. The following summer, I interned at JP Morgan Chase, completing data analysis projects for their home lending department. I spent the summer of 2022 in Toronto, working on creating a biomedical hyperspectral image analysis package as part of the Fields Institute REU. I served as the undergraduate representative of the Diversity and Departmental Climate Committee for the Math department for 3 years, advocating for equitable opportunities in the program. I also was the social media chair for OSU’s Association of Women in Mathematics.

            <p>After graduating in 2023, I found myself at a crossroads. I had done the impossible and completed a very demanding degree while feeling isolated because of the lack of diversity. On paper, I was ready to move on to the next step: a PhD in geometry or graphics. However, I had ignored much of my identity and creative passions to fill this mold, leaving me feeling burnt out. So I made the difficult decision and turned down my PhD offer to live at home with my Mom and rot in an existential crisis. While these months were some of the most difficult of my life, they were invaluable to beginning a journey of reclaiming all the parts of me I had cut off. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>After spending more than enough time at home, I decided it was time for a change and went to visit my friend at her post-college adventure: Holden Village, a remote off-grid Lutheran Retreat Center in the North Cascade Mountains of Washington. Despite not being religious, I decided to volunteer there as a cook for 2 months. The nature and hiking opportunities were so beautiful that I decided to remain there for 7 more months as a Graphic Designer, focusing on growing into myself. Not only did I gain skills in graphic design software, working with contractors, and collaborating on multi-departmental projects, but I also learned just how important intentionally engaging in community is. The things I am most proud of are not design projects, but the dance classes and events I led, the people I made smile, and the pottery I created. I also picked up a few wild card skills like Wilderness First Aid, stoking boilers, and how to work a fire hose.

            <br>
            <p>Currently, I am completing my master’s in Interactive Media Technology at KTH in Stockholm. While my relationship with technology is very strained and I have an existential crisis every month about how to live an ethically aligned life, I am making the most of what the city has to offer. I am lucky to be part of an international group of students who are all extremely caring and creatively talented. I have found community in dance, participating in dance events of every style from salsa socials to Afrobeats classes. I have also had the opportunity to lead my own workshops centered on the body, combining dance with ethical questions about technology. As I live authentically, I become an artist, designer, community organizer, and researcher all embodied into one corporeal form. While I have no idea what is in store, I am excited for the adventure!
